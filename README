This is a Netflix.com clone.
This project is using Firebase for the authentication process and for the database.

The user will need to Sign Up in order to Browse for a movie.

By doing this project I explored: 

  - Enabling Authentication for a User (powered by Firebase).
  - Using Protected Routes (for non-Users)
  - Redirection
  - Compound and Styled Components, and more.
